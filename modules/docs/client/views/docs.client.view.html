				<ul>
					<li>Build form templates.</li>
					<li>Structure data with a 3 branch pattern.</li>
					<li>Outsourced API of the data.</li>
					<li>Maintain and change the data.</li>

				<h3 id="vision">Vision</h3>
				<p>Giving people simplistic way to store data and out source it for their own use in JSON. - Easy storage structure not
					for complex data. - It will allow easey management with easy navigation through personal raw alphanumerical data.</p>
				<h3 id="description">Program's Description</h3>
				<p>The program implements a system which allows the user to customize a way to store data. Providing tools for form creation
					which serves are data entry. And the data is structured in a way which is simple and allows flexability. We see provided
					data as information which is only significant for the user. - Using general decisions to differentiate the input from
					different types of data. This allows the user to store meaningful information. The data structure consist of 4 main
					componets. Storage -> Category -> Record and a Form</p>
				<ul>
					<li>Storage</li>
					<li style="list-style-type:none">
						<ul>
							<li>It is a wapper that wraps all the categories into a unit which can be represented as a theme of data which is being
								stored in there.</li>
							<li>e.g. Shop, Restaurant, Class Room etc.</li>
						</ul>
					</li>
					<li>Category</li>
					<li style="list-style-type:none">
						<ul>
							<li>Categorises records within a Storage. - This allows for record seperation.</li>
							<li>It acts as another container for data same as the Storage.</li>
							<li>e.g. Products, Staff, Sales etc.</li>
						</ul>
					</li>
					<li>Record</li>
					<li style="list-style-type:none">
						<ul>
							<li>Record is an entity stored in a category representing one entry.</li>
							<li>Each record consist of values assigned by the user which hold the information.</li>
							<li>e.g. Clothing shop storage -> Suit category -> price, size, brand and color attributes within a record.</li>
						</ul>
					</li>
					<li>Form</li>
					<li style="list-style-type:none">
						<ul>
							<li>Form is a template with record attributes created bu the user.</li>
							<li>Using that form the user has structure for every record</li>
							<li>e.g. price : Number, size : Dropdown list, color, Dropdown list etc.</li>
						</ul>
